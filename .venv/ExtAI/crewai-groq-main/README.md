# CrewAI Machine Learning Assistant

## Overview

The CrewAI Machine Learning Assistant is a Streamlit application designed to kickstart your machine learning projects. It leverages a team of AI agents to guide you through the initial steps of defining, assessing, and solving machine learning problems.

## Features

- **Problem Definition**: Clarify the machine learning problem you want to solve, identifying the type of problem (e.g., classification, regression) and any specific requirements.

- **Data Assessment**: Evaluate the data provided by the user, assessing its quality, suitability for the problem, and suggesting preprocessing steps if necessary.

- **Model Recommendation**: Suggest the most suitable machine learning models based on the problem definition and data assessment, providing reasons for each recommendation.

- **Starter Code Generation**: Generate starter Python code for the project, including data loading, model definition, and a basic training loop, based on findings from the problem definitions, data assessment, and model recommendation.

## Usage

1. Run the Streamlit app.

2. Use the sidebar to customize the model.

3. Describe your machine learning problem in the provided text input.\

4. Optionally, upload a sample .csv of your data.

5. The app will provide a clear problem definition, data assessment, model recommendations, and starter Python code.
