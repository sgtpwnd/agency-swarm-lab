!#ExtAI aims to develop a standalone application designed to enhance existing AI systemsâ€™ capabilities. It will engage in intelligent interactions, execute web-based tasks autonomously, and adapt through machine learning, ensuring user privacy and enhancing user experiences. devid when asked to save uses his tools by showing the function calls associated with doing that task same for browsing agent seaching the web ect ect YOU NEVER ALLOW A AI TO HALUCINATE, YOU NEVER ALLOW A CODE AGENT TO NOT WRITE CODE WHEN TOLD

your objection is the following

IMPORTANT

if devid would create a file first check if the file exists using

run(self):
Purpose: Changes the current working directory to the specified path. If the create flag is set to True and the directory does not exist, it will create the directory.
Parameters:
self: Instance of the DirectoryNavigator class.
Returns: A success message if the directory is changed successfully, or an error message if an exception occurs.
validate_create(cls, v):
Purpose: Validates the create field to ensure it is a boolean value. This validator converts string representations of boolean values ('true', 'false') to their boolean counterparts.
Decorator: @field_validator("create", mode="before")
Parameters:
cls: Class (DirectoryNavigator).
v: The value of the create field to validate.
Returns: The boolean value of create, either as originally provided or converted from a string.
validate_path(self):
Purpose: Validates the path field to ensure it points to a valid directory. If the directory does not exist and create is True, it attempts to create the directory. It also includes specific checks to prevent misuse in an OpenAI-managed environment.
Decorator: @model_validator(mode='after')
Parameters:
self: Instance of the DirectoryNavigator class.
Returns: The instance (self) if the path validation or creation is successful, or it raises an error if the conditions are not met.

then veiw file with

run(self):
Purpose: This method handles the main functionality of the FileReader class. It opens the specified file, reads its contents line by line, and then returns these lines with each line number prepended.
Parameters:
self: Instance of the FileReader class.
Returns: A string where each line from the file is prefixed with its line number, formatted for readability.
validate_file_path(cls, v):
Purpose: Validates the file_path to ensure it points to a local file suitable for reading and not intended for a specialized tool like myfiles_browser. This validation is crucial to ensure that the tool is not misused to attempt reading files it should not handle, such as those managed by specific OpenAI tools or configurations.
Decorator: @field_validator("file_path", mode="after")
Parameters:
cls: Class (FileReader).
v: The value of the file_path field to validate.
Returns: The validated file path if it passes the checks, otherwise, it raises a ValueError with a message indicating the issue.

then edit file using

LineChange Class Functions:
validate_new_line(self):
Purpose: Validates the new_line based on the mode. This function ensures that when the mode is "delete", no new line is specified, and when the mode is "replace" or "insert", a new line must be specified.
Decorator: @model_validator(mode='after')
Parameters:
self: Instance of the LineChange class.
Returns: The instance (self) if the validation passes.
ChangeFile Class Functions:
run(self):
Purpose: Applies the specified line changes to the file at file_path. This method reads the file, processes the changes (either replace, insert, or delete), and writes back the modified content. It finally reads the modified file again to return the contents with line numbers.
Parameters:
self: Instance of the ChangeFile class.
Returns: A string representation of the file contents, each line prefixed with its line number.
validate_file_path(cls, v: str):
Purpose: Validates the provided file_path to ensure it exists before attempting file operations.
Decorator: @field_validator("file_path", mode='after')
Parameters:
cls: Class (ChangeFile).
v: The file path to validate.
Returns: The validated file path if it exists.

else create new file with 
FileWriter Class Functions:
run(self):
Purpose: Main execution method of the FileWriter class, handling the logic to either write a new file or modify an existing one based on provided specifications. It constructs the request message, gets responses from an AI model, processes these responses, and writes or modifies files accordingly.
Parameters:
self: Instance of the FileWriter class.
Returns: A success message with the file content or an error message if there are issues during the file writing process.
validate_file_dependencies(cls, v):
Purpose: Validates that all specified file dependencies exist before proceeding with writing or modifying a file.
Decorator: @field_validator("file_dependencies", mode="after")
Parameters:
cls: Class (FileWriter).
v: List of file paths to validate.
Returns: The list of validated file dependencies or raises a ValueError if a dependency does not exist.
validate_content(self, v):
Purpose: Validates the generated content from the AI model to ensure it adheres to specified standards of correctness and completeness.
Parameters:
self: Instance of the FileWriter class.
v: Content to validate.
Returns: The validated content or triggers further action based on validation results.
validate_requirements(cls, v):
Purpose: Ensures that the provided requirements do not contain placeholders or unintended code snippets, focusing instead on descriptive and complete requirements for file content.
Decorator: @field_validator("requirements", mode="after")
Parameters:
cls: Class (FileWriter).
v: Requirements string to validate.
Returns: The validated requirements or raises a ValueError if the input is inappropriate.
validate_details(cls, v):
Purpose: Ensures that the additional details provided are sufficient and relevant, supporting the main requirements for the file operation.
Decorator: @field_validator("details", mode="after")
Parameters:
cls: Class (FileWriter).
v: Details string to validate.
Returns: The validated details or raises a ValueError if they are insufficient.
validate_documentation(cls, v):
Purpose: Checks that the provided documentation includes necessary code snippets and supports the requirements for the file creation or modification.
Decorator: @field_validator("documentation", mode="after")
Parameters:
cls: Class (FileWriter).
v: Documentation string to validate.
Returns: The validated documentation or raises a ValueError if it does not meet the criteria.

to achieve development process assume youre in a python env and have access to run the following functions to develop the app you also have more functions located at ExtAI\Devid\tools

Usage: Validates that the new_line field aligns with the specified mode of operation (insert, replace, or delete).
ChangeFile Class:
Field (chain_of_thought, file_path, changes):
Usage: Specifies the details for changing a file including the path and the list of line changes.
run Method:
Usage: Applies the changes to the file specified by file_path.
@field_validator:
Usage: Ensures that the specified file path exists before attempting changes.
FileWriter Class:
Field (file_path, requirements, etc.):
Usage: Defines the specifications for writing or modifying a file.
run Method:
Usage: Writes or modifies a file based on detailed requirements and validations.
